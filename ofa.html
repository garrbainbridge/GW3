        <h1>One for All</h1>
        <p>Long ago, All For One, a man with a Quirk that allows him to steal other people's Quirks 
        and transfer them to others, forced a Quirk on his seemingly Quirkless younger brother, Yoichi. 
        This Quirk allowed him to stockpile power within his body. However, unbeknownst to either 
        one of them, Yoichi already had a Quirk with no other power than that it could be transferred 
        to another person. The transference Quirk and the power stockpiling Quirk merged to form One 
        For All.</p>
        <img src="images/ofa/past.gif" alt="previous users passing on one for all">
        <p>He decided to entrust the Quirk to future generations of heroes, hoping that they   
        would be able to cultivate One For All and one day put a stop to All For One. He passed 
        it on to the second user, one of the heroes who had freed him from the prison cell 
        where his brother was keeping him.
        The fourth, fifth and sixth users passing down One For All.
        All For One sought out One For All and as a result, almost all of the users of One For All 
        fought him and were killed by his hand, but not before they each had the chance to pass on 
        the Quirk to a successor so that it could reach the future and elude the villain.</p>

            <p>He was supposedly the leader of a resistance movement that fought against All For One's 
                new world order during the peak of his power. He did everything he could to fight back, 
                including taking the lives of anyone who stood in their way. He initially had plans 
                to kill Yoichi due to his ties to All For One, before having a change of heart and 
                choosing to save him instead, inadvertently allowing One For All to grow in the 
                first place.</p>

            <p>He was part of the resistance fighting against All For One alongside the second user. 
                He was there during the assassination attempt on Yoichi before deciding to rescue him 
                instead.</p>

            <p>Unlike the other users, Hikage chose not to confront All For One, aware of the enormous 
                gap in power between them, and instead spent his time in seclusion, training himself and 
                strengthening One For All for his successor. During the final years of his life, his body 
                started to break down, causing scars. Hikage passed One For All onto Daigoro before dying 
                at the age of forty.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Toshinori has wielded One For All longer than any other user, for a total of forty years, 
                while almost all the other users were either killed by All For One or died of old age due to 
                the burden of One For All. The reason Toshinori was able to hold One For All for so long is 
                revealed to be because he was born Quirkless, meaning he could bear the burden of the Quirk
                since he was an empty vessel One For All could fill.</p>

                <p>Toshinori, better known as the Pro Hero, All Might, is probably the best-known user of the Quirk.
                Throughout his career, Toshinori was regarded as the most powerful hero of all time and 
                remained undefeated. With the goal of being a pillar for society, he put One For All to 
                great use, defeating all sorts of criminals, rescuing countless people from danger, and 
                turning himself into a legend.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Initially, Izuku had very little control over the Quirk and could only use One For All at 
                100% power, grievously injuring his own body each time, and only in short bursts at that. 
                While this allowed him to unleash incredible displays of strength, it came at potentially 
                lifelong physical costs, resulting in him currently having a visibly scarred, permanently 
                crooked right hand and arm. This is because the training Izuku did prior to receiving the 
                Quirk was only the bare minimum needed for using One For All without his limbs being blown 
                off completely.</p>

                <p>Izuku can now use One for All at its full power and has awakened the quirks of the 
                    previous users.</p>
