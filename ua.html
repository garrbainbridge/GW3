                            Quirk, he needs to consume 10 grams of sugar. When converting sugar into 
                            strength, his cognitive functions gradually drop, making him very sleepy 
                            afterward. For every additional 10 grams of sugar he ingests, he extends the 
                            time of increased strength by another three minutes.</p>
