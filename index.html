            <h1>My Hero Academia</h1>
            <p>The appearance of "quirks," newly discovered super powers, has been steadily increasing 
                over the years, with 80 percent of humanity possessing various abilities from manipulation
                of elements to shape-shifting etc. The 20 percent of mankind who do not possess a power 
                are called "quirkless", and are usually looked down on upon the supernatural community. 
                Academies across the globe train their students to learn to fight crime with their 
                powers. Izuku Midoriya, a boy born without any powers, dreams of being able to become 
                a super hero too, but gets bullied for his unrealistic dreams. One day, his fate 
                changes in an unexpected meeting with the no.1 hero all might, and he is given the 
                chance to become his successor and inherent one for all, a quirk with a dark history, 
                which is passed down from successor to successor, who cultivates it with their own 
                power and passes it on, to defeat it's brother, all for one.</p>

            <h1>Quirks</h1>
            <p>A Quirk, is a superhuman ability that a person can possess.<br>Along with being unique to 
                each user, Quirks are sorted into multiple categories. Quirk users are also limited to 
                only developing one ability and are thus unable to achieve any other through natural 
                means.</p>

                <p>The first Meta Ability was manifested by a newborn baby in Qing Qing City, China 
                    with the ability to radiate light from its body. After this phenomenon, many people 
                    around the world began to manifest different kinds of superpowers, which became 
                    known as Meta Abilities.

                    <p>Quirks are said to be the next stage of evolution in the human race. It is possible, 
                        though rudimentary, to diagnose a person as possessing or lacking a Quirk by analyzing
                        the presence or absence of an extra joint in their pinky toe. People with only one 
                        joint tend to develop a Quirk, while having two joints usually indicates that the 
                        person is Quirkless. The lack of the extra joint makes a person's body more 
                        "streamlined", a secondary aspect of human evolution brought about by the emergence
                        of Quirks.

            <p>The theory of "Quirk Singularity" is a popular line of thinking that suggests 
                that Quirks will continue to mix together and deepen, growing in both strength 
                and complexity with every new generation. Eventually, Quirks will develop to a 
                point where no one will be able to control them anymore.</p>

            <p>In Japan, Professional Heroes are officially ranked by taking several factors into 
                account, such as the level of strength they have displayed, the number of cases they
                have solved, their general popularity, and their overall contribution to society. 
                The Hero Public Safety Commission reviews the activity of all the Heroes in the country 
                over the past year and uses a formula to organize and review all the aforementioned
                factors. The results are presented as the new Hero rankings.
